Spike sorting for Kontroller

![image](images/hero.png)

`spikesort` can read data generated by [Kontroller](https://github.com/sg-s/kontroller) and help you sort spikes from multiple neurons in a single extracellular voltage recording. This was developed for sorting the action potentials of Drosophila Olfactory Receptor Neurons, but would probably work in other contexts. 

## Features

### Fast Filter and Find Spikes in trace

### Several algorithms for dimensional reduction

Every problem is different. To deal with unknown unknowns, `spikesort` ships with a number of methods for dimensionality reduction. All these methods are built around an awesome [plugin](#plugin-architecture) architecture, making inclusion of new methods a breeze.  

### Several algorithms for data clustering

Likewise, data clustering is achieved through plugins, allowing you to customise `spikesort` for any task. 

### Native support for [Kontroller](https://github.com/sg-s/kontroller)-generated data

### export all traces to EPS figures.

### BSD xattr-based file tagging. 

Limited support for the [extended file attribute](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_file_attributes) system on *nix-like systems. `spikesort` automatically tags files it touches so it makes working with lots of files easier. 

## Limitations 

* for various reasons, sorting into only two groups (A and B) is supported. spikesort will not support more than 2 groups

## Installation

spikesort is written in MATLAB.

If you have `git` installed:

````
git clone git@github.com:sg-s/spikesort.git
````

or use [this link](https://github.com/sg-s/spikesort/archive/master.zip).

# Hacking

## Plugin architecture

`spikesort` is built around a plugin architectue for the two most important things it does: 

* dimensionality reduction of spike shapes
* clustering 

### Default plugins

`spikesort` ships with the following default plugins for dimensionality reduction:

1. (1D) spike amplitudes
2. (1D) fractional spike amplitudes
3. (1D) relative spike amplitudes
3. (2D) Principal Components 

and the following default plugins for clustering:

1. (1D) Gaussian Mixture Models
2. (2D) Manual Clustering 
3. (ND) Density-Peaks clustering 

### Writing your own plugins

Writing your own plugins is really easy: `spikesort` does the heavy lifting in figuring out how to talk to it, and all you have to is write a function that conforms to a few standards:

#### Naming.
Dimensionality reduction plugins have to be called `ssdm_foo.m` and clusttering method plugins have to be called `sscm_bar.m`. Put them in the same folder as 	`spikesort` and it will automatically include them. 

#### Outputs
A dimensionality reduction plugin is a function must return a variable called `R`, that is usually a vector or a matrix (but can be whatever you want)

A clustering plugin is a function that must return two variables `A` and `B` that indicate vector indices of spikes of neuron 1 and neuron 2 in the current voltage trace. 

#### Inputs
Both types of plugins are functions that can have any inputs whatsoever -- provided you reference the correct variable names in spikesort. Since `V` is a variable used to denote the filtered voltage in `spikesort`, you can ask for `V` in your function definition as follows:

````matlab
function R = ssdm_my_awesome_plugin(V,foo,bar)
````	

and `spikesort` will intelligently give your function the correct variables in the correct order (spikesort reads your function and figures this out).
